First goal is just make videos with morphy landscapes. I want to do this by constructing
images corresponding to a random walk in the latent space of a generative model,
probably a GAN.

The following tutorial shows to train a GAN and perform interpolation in the latent
space to generate videos which transition between two images. This is a good place to
look for inspiration.

Looking at the recent NVAE would also be a good idea, since it would allow for easy
image encoding.

Flowers dataset came from: https://www.kaggle.com/alxmamaev/flowers-recognition

Refactoring:
- Make number of generator/discriminator layers options
- Initialization options
